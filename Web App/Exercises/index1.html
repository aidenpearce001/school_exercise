            The World Wide Web (www, W3) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by URIs, interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. It has become known simply as the Web. Hypertext 100 documents are commonly called web pages, which are primarily text documents formatted and annotated with the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Webpages may contain links to images, video, and software components that are rendered to users of a web browser application, running on the user’s computer, as coherent pages of multimedia content. Embedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate between web pages. When multiple web pages are published with a common theme or within a common domain name, the collection is usually called a web site.
